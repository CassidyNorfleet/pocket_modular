Throughout the development processes I tested LibPd and Pure Data integration with android studio by logging out messages 
sent to "pocket_modular.pd" to ensure it was being properly received.

I tested UI components by visually observing my interactions in the app and seeing if anything differed from what I expected.

I logged out values from various sliders as well as the position of items in the dropdown menu from the matrix module to 
verify that it coincided with receivers in "pocket_modular.pd" and didn't exceed any of the corresponding values.
