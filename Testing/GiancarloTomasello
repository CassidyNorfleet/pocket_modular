For my portion of the project I performed several informal test to get the midi pure data patch to work.

First, as a proof of concept. I created a layout that would receive numbers in place of midi information to get the routing and
settings managment to work. I did this by creating print statements in pure data to check the information was being sent

Then I worked to rewrite the number patch to take in midi data, which is number pairs containing note info, velocity data, and channel data.
To test this I created number pairs that acted as the midi information I would revieve from a midi controller and tested my functions that
kept track of the note number (which note was played first and which was second and so forth) as well as seperating the note and velocity
information. I again used print statements to make sure the data I wanted was routed to the correct places

Finally I replaced all my number pairs with midi notein nodes and used a midi controller to send data through the file. I used print 
statements to check if the informartion was being routed correctly as well as listening to the sounds that were created by the matrix.
If the notes made a sound when pressed then It was working as intended.
