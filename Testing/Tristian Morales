During development I worked on and tested the individual PureData(PD) patches(excluding the mod matrix).

For the Oscilator I ran tests to see if the patch could produce the correct wave form by turning on the 
correct toggle in PD and adding a [key] object to act as a test double for midi input. I also added the 
[dac~] object to act as a test spy so that the output could be expressed as an audio signal. These were 
done in the code and were later removed.

For the Envelope I ran a similar test to the Oscilator, however the setup for test stub used [keyup] and 
didn't accurately approximate the midi input. This meant that the error which failed to trigger the Release 
wasn't caught until it couldn't be fixed.

For the Filter I added a [noise~] object as a test stub and directly manipulated the toggles and float values 
which would be manipulated by receive messages. This did not require me having to rewrite code for the 
receive messages.

For the Amplifier I used the same test as the Oscilator.
